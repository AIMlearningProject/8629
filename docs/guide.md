✅ PROJECT 2 — “Centria Logo 3D Prints (Pins, Magnet, Keyring, Cake Mould)”
PHASE 1 — Logo Asset Prep (Day 1–2)

Collect official logos:

FI version

EN version

“C” symbol

Remove backgrounds (Illustrator / Inkscape).

Convert to vector (SVG).

Clean nodes → reduce complexity.

Export final SVG set:

Centria_FI.svg

Centria_EN.svg

Centria_C.svg

PHASE 2 — Base 3D Geometry (Day 2–4)

Import SVG into Blender.

Convert curve → mesh.

Fix topology:

Merge vertices

Make watertight

Extrude base geometry for all logos (2–4 mm).

PHASE 3 — Variant Creation (Day 4–7)

For each logo, build 4 objects:

A) Pin

3–4 mm thickness

Add small cylindrical mount on the back

B) Magnet

4–5 mm thickness

Add shallow magnet recess on back

C) Keyring

5–6 mm thickness

Add reinforced loop (Ø 6–7 mm)

D) Cake Mould

8–12 mm height

Reverse relief (impression goes into dough)

Rounded corners (no sharp edges)

PHASE 4 — Test Prints (Day 7–9)

Print 1 prototype per type

Evaluate:

detail sharpness

strength

mould release

Make adjustments if needed

PHASE 5 — Final Delivery (Day 10)
