Project 2: Centria Logo Branding Items (Code 8629)
Project Name: Centria Logo 3D Branding Items
Project Code: 8629

Software Development Plan
1. Requirements Analysis & Planning (Week 1)

Objective: Define the scope and specifications for each branded item.

Tasks:

Item Breakdown: For each logo (Finnish, English, C-letter), decide which items it will be used for (Pin, Magnet, Keyring, Cake Mould).

Technical Specs: Define precise dimensions, thickness, and attachment methods (e.g., pin clasp type, magnet size, keyring loop diameter).

Material Selection: Choose appropriate 3D printing materials (e.g., durable PLA for keyrings, food-safe resin for cake moulds).

Deliverables: A matrix specifying logo-to-item mapping and a technical spec sheet for each item type.

2. System Design (Vector Asset Preparation)

Objective: Prepare clean, 3D-printable versions of the logos.

Tasks:

Obtain high-resolution logo files.

In vector software, meticulously remove backgrounds and clean up the artwork.

Simplify complex details if they are too fine for 3D printing.

Save each logo variant as a separate SVG file.

Deliverables: centria_logo_fin.svg, centria_logo_eng.svg, centria_letter_c.svg

3. Implementation (3D Modeling & Variation Creation)

Objective: Create distinct 3D models for each branded item type.

Tasks:

Base Model: For each logo, create a standard 3D extruded version.

Pin Model: Add a pin clasp model to the back of the base model.

Magnet Model: Create a recess on the back of the base model to embed a magnet.

Keyring Model: Add a robust loop integrated into the design.

Cake Mould Model: Create a negative/inverse of the logo, ensuring it's a single, watertight volume with appropriate wall height and a flat base.

Deliverables: Multiple .blend files (e.g., logo_pin.blend, logo_mould.blend), organized by logo and item type.

4. Testing (Iterative Prototyping)

Objective: Test the functionality and durability of each item type.

Tasks:

Print prototypes for one of each item type (e.g., one pin, one magnet).

Functional Tests: Check clasp strength, magnet hold, keyring loop integrity.

Mould Test: Conduct a test bake with the cake mould prototype using appropriate food-safe material.

Gather stakeholder feedback on aesthetics and perceived quality.

Deliverables: Set of physical prototypes, test report, feedback summary.

5. Deployment (Batch Production & Delivery)

Objective: Produce the final batches of items for distribution.

Tasks:

Finalize all models based on prototype testing.

Prepare print sheets for batch production, optimally arranging multiple items to save time and material.

Execute the final print runs for each item type.

Post-process prints and assemble components (e.g., glue magnets/pin clasps).

Package and deliver the final items to the project owner.

Deliverables: Batches of finished Pins, Magnets, Keyrings, and Cake Moulds; a complete archive of all final digital assets.
